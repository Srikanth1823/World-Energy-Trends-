# World-Energy-Trends-

In today’s world, Energy plays a crucial role in driving economic growth and development and in meeting the basic needs of individuals and communities. The demand is rapidly increasing due to population growth, rapid industrialization, and urbanization which is putting pressure on World's energy resources. Therefore, understanding energy trends and their implications is essential to make informed decisions. 

 This project aims to explore the latest trends in the energy sector over the last decade. Including the production and consumption of various energy resources, such as Fossil fuels, Biofuels, Renewable energy sources, and nuclear energy. In the context of global warming and climate change, I will also analyze the world's commitment to carbon neutrality. Energy conservation has become a crucial factor in the backdrop of soaring energy prices and inflation in the world economy. Energy efficiency is a critical aspect of energy conservation and promoting sustainable development. It is a measure of how effectively a country is using energy resources to generate economic output while minimizing emissions and wastage. Analyzing the energy efficiencies of countries can provide valuable insights into energy conservation practices and policymaking. 

Additionally, this project aims to examine the relationship among population, Energy consumption, Economic status, and Emissions of countries. By analyzing these relationships. I wanted to identify key areas countries need to focus on to promote sustainable development and create a happier planet.
